## Installation

0. Download the `.vsix` file from the `dist` folder
1. View -> Command Palette -> Extensions: Install from VSIX
2. Pick the `.vsix` file

## How to develop the theme

1. Go to the folder of the project and run `code .`.
2. Then press F5 (Run -> Start debugging). The newly opened window is basically the preview of the theme. So, load some other project there. Change colors (themes/Kalia-color-theme.json) in the main window and see how they affect the code in the new window.
