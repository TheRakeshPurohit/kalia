## How to develop the theme

Open VSCode and load the theme folder as a project folder. Then press F5 (Run -> Start debugging). The newly opened window is basically the preview of the theme. So, load some other project there. Change colors (themes/Kalia-color-theme.json) in the main window and see how they affect the code in the new window.
