# Kalia

Kalia is a [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) theme for those of you that like dark themes. But it's not just about beautiful colors. Kalia is styling your code based on context. Think about a string. If it is used as a function argument is one color and if it is placed as a tag attribute is another.

Here are the main characteristics:

* Pastel colors near monochromic
* Balanced contrast
* Contextual colors
